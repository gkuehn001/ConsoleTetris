                  ConsoleTetris - Project Overview
========================================================================

This project started as a test project to get familiar with the C++ programming language.

It is created without a fancy GUI as a pure console application.

The graphical representation of the game state is done by using PDCurses (Public Domain Curses)
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdcurses/

Feel free to use the code or contribute to the project.
